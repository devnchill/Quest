code -> compiler -> executable

#### Structure 

package main -> lets compiler know that we want to run this as a standalone program rather than as a library 

import "fmt" -> fmt stands for formatting input output , this allows to use fmt.Println which helps to print things to console

func main -> serves as entry point for the program
